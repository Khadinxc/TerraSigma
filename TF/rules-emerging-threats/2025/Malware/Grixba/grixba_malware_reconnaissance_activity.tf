This tool is used by the Play ransomware group for network enumeration, data gathering, and event log clearing. - Legitimate tools that use similar command-line argument structures (e.g., a tool with '--mode scan' and '--input file.txt') could trigger this rule. However, the specific combinations are indicative of reconnaissance or defense evasion."
