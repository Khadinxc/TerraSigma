// Title: Linux Suspicious Child Process from Node.js - React2Shell
// Author: Swachchhanda Shrawan Poudel (Nextron Systems), Nasreddine Bencherchali
// Date: 2025-12-05
// Level: high
// Description: Detects suspicious child processes spawned from Node.js server processes on Linux systems, potentially indicating remote code execution exploitation such as CVE-2025-55182 (React2Shell).
// This rule particularly looks for exploitation of vulnerability on Node.js Servers where attackers abuse Node.js child_process module to execute arbitrary system commands.
// When execSync() or exec() is used, the command line often includes a shell invocation followed by suspicious commands or scripts (e.g., /bin/sh -c <malicious-command>).
// For other methods, the Image field will show the spawned process directly.
